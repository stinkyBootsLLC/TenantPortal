# Tenant Portal Prototype

## Purpose:
Property Management Solution

I created this project to showcase my PHP and MySQL database skills. This is a simple 
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) web application. The purpose of this application, 
is to track maintenance issues for a property manager. Tenants can register to this 
application and report simple maintenance issues, up to the property manager.There is a 
login form for a tenant and a login form for a maintainer (manager). Once the maintainer 
logs in, they will be able to see all the issues reported by their Tenants. Issues are 
categorized in three categories, open, pending and closed

Open - issue reported, but NOT scheduled for repair
Pending - issue IS scheduled for repaired
Closed - issue HAS BEEN repaired (history)
Currently; for security purposes, the user does not have the ability to update or delete 
their profile. This is a feature I am still working on.

## Future Features:

- User securely update and delete profile
- Email Notification
- SMS Notification
- Picture of problem (Upload)
